# Technology-Used


Used Visual Studio Code editor to write the HTML, CSS and Javascript code.

HTML - HTML was used to create the structure and foundation of the landing page.

CSS - used css to style the website to look appealing to the user.

Javascript - Used Javascript to create functions, conditions and loops to manipulate items on the webpage. Especially added event listeners that can listen and trigger a function when features like form submit, mouseover and button are triggered.

Employed the help of www.w3schools.com to be able to add and remove class attributes. With the help of stackoverflow.com I was able to add the function to allow only one answer to be selcted at a time.
